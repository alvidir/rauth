## About

The rauth project provides a **SSO** (Single Sign On) implementation that can be consumed as any of both, a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) library or a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) service. Currently, the project includes all regular session-related actions as signup, login, logout, and so on. Plus **TOTP**(Time-based One Time Password) and email verification support.

## Endpoints
### **Signup**

Allows a new user to get registered into the system if, and only if, `email` and `password` are both valid.

#### Request

The **signup** transaction requires of **two steps** to get completed: the _signup request_, and the _email verification_. Both of them use the same endpoint to get performed, nonetheless, the _signup request_ is the only one that must all fields. The _email verification_ instead, shall provide the **verification token** in the corresponding header.

``` yaml
# Example of a gRPC message for the signup endpoint

{
    "email": "dummy@test.com" # an string containing the user's email,
    "pwd": "1234567890ABCDEF" # an string containing the user's password encoded in base64
}
```

#### Response
- If, and only if, the first step of the signup transaction completed successfully, Rauth will respond with the error `E003` (require email verification).
- If, and only if, the email verification completed successfully, is sent an Empty response with the session token in the corresponding header.
- Otherwise, is provided one of the errors down below.

#### Error codes

| **Code** | Name | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
**E001**|ERR_UNKNOWN| Unprevisible errors
**E002**|ERR_NOT_FOUND| Token header not found
**E005**|ERR_INVALID_TOKEN| Token is invalid because of any of the following reasons: bad format, `exp` time exceeded, bad signature, `nbf` not satisfied, wrong `knd` or not catched.
**E006**|ERR_INVALID_FORMAT| Invalid format for `email` or `password`
**E007**|ERR_INVALID_HEADER| Token header must be encoded in base64

### **Reset**

Allows an existing user to reset its password.

#### Request

The **reset** transaction requires of **two steps** to get completed: the _email verification_, and the _password reset_. Both of them use the same endpoint to get performed, nonetheless, they do differ in which fields are mandatory. 

``` yaml
# Example of a gRPC message for the first step of the reset endpoint

{
    "email": "dummy@test.com" # an string containing the user's email,
    "pwd": "" # not required
    "totp": "" # not required
}

# Example of a gRPC message for the second step of the reset endpoint
{
    "email": "" # not required
    "pwd": "1234567890ABCDEF" # an string containing the user's password encoded in base64
    "totp": "123456" # the TOTP of the user, if enabled
}
```

> The second step must provide in the corresponding header the token that the verification email gave to ensure the legitimacy of the action.

#### Response
- If, and only if, the first step of the reset transaction completed successfully, Rauth will respond with the error `E003` (require email verification).
- If, and only if, the password reset completed successfully, is sent an Empty response with no errors.
- Otherwise, is provided one of the errors down below.

#### Error codes
| **Code** | Name | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
**E001**|ERR_UNKNOWN| Unprevisible errors
**E002**|ERR_NOT_FOUND| Token header not found
**E004**|ERR_UNAUTHORIZED| Totp required
**E005**|ERR_INVALID_TOKEN| Token is invalid because of any of the following reasons: bad format, `exp` time exceeded, bad signature, `nbf` not satisfied, wrong `knd` or not catched.
**E006**|ERR_INVALID_FORMAT| Password must be encoded in base64
**E007**|ERR_INVALID_HEADER| Token header must be encoded in base64
**E008**|ERR_WRONG_CREDENTIALS| The new password cannot match the old one or invalid `user id`.


### **Delete**

Allows an existing user to delete its account.

#### Request

The **delete** transaction requires the user to be logged in, so its session token must be provided in the corresponding header of the request.

``` yaml
# Example of a gRPC message for the delete endpoint

{
    "pwd": "1234567890ABCDEF" # an string containing the user's password encoded in base64
    "totp": "123456" # the TOTP of the user, if enabled
}
```

#### Response
- If, and only if, the deletion completed successfully, is sent an Empty response with no errors.
- Otherwise, is provided one of the errors down below.

#### Error codes
| **Code** | Name | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
**E001**|ERR_UNKNOWN| Unprevisible errors
**E002**|ERR_NOT_FOUND| Token header not found
**E004**|ERR_UNAUTHORIZED| Totp required
**E005**|ERR_INVALID_TOKEN| Token is invalid because of any of the following reasons: bad format, `exp` time exceeded, bad signature, `nbf` not satisfied, wrong `knd` or not catched.
**E007**|ERR_INVALID_HEADER| Token header must be encoded in base64
**E008**|ERR_WRONG_CREDENTIALS| Password does not match or invalid `user id`.

### **Totp**

Allows an existing user to enable or disable the time-based one time password

#### Request

The **totp** transaction requires the user to be logged in, so its session token must be provided in the corresponding header of the request. Besides, the enabling option requires of **two steps** to get completed: the action itself, and the totp verification. In any case, the same endpoint is consumed.

``` yaml
# Example of a gRPC message for the totp endpoint

{
    "action": x, # where x may be 0 or 1 for enabling or disabling totp respectively
    "pwd": "1234567890ABCDEF" # an string containing the user's password encoded in base64
    "totp": "" # not required if, and only if, is the first step of enabling totp
}

# Example of a gRPC message for the second step of enabling the totp

{
    "action": 0, # 0: enable totp action
    "pwd": "1234567890ABCDEF" # an string containing the user's password encoded in base64
    "totp": "123456" # the correct totp for the given secret
}
```

#### Response
- If, and only if, the first step of enabling the TOTP completed successfully, is provided the TOTP's secret in the corresponding header.
- If, and only if, the second step of enabling the TOTP completed successfully, is sent an Empty response with no errors.
- If, and only if, disabling TOTP completed successfully, is sent an Empty response with no errors.
- Otherwise, is provided one of the errors down below.

#### Error codes
| **Code** | Name | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
**E001**|ERR_UNKNOWN| Unprevisible errors
**E002**|ERR_NOT_FOUND| Token header not found
**E003**|ERR_NOT_AVAILABLE| The action cannot be performed
**E004**|ERR_UNAUTHORIZED| Invalid `totp` value
**E005**|ERR_INVALID_TOKEN| Token is invalid because of any of the following reasons: bad format, `exp` time exceeded, bad signature, `nbf` not satisfied, wrong `knd` or not catched.
**E007**|ERR_INVALID_HEADER| Token header must be encoded in base64
**E008**|ERR_WRONG_CREDENTIALS| Password does not match or invalid `user id`.

### **Login**

Allows an existing user to log in.

#### Request

``` yaml
# Example of a gRPC message for the login endpoint

{
    "ident": "dummy" # username or password
    "pwd": "1234567890ABCDEF" # an string containing the user's password encoded in base64
    "totp": "123456" # the TOTP of the user, if enabled
}
```

#### Response
- If, and only if, the login completed successfully, is sent an Empty response with the session token in the corresponding header.
- Otherwise, is provided one of the errors down below.

#### Error codes
| **Code** | Name | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
**E001**|ERR_UNKNOWN| Unprevisible errors
**E004**|ERR_UNAUTHORIZED| Totp required
**E008**|ERR_WRONG_CREDENTIALS| Invalid `username` or `password`

### **Logout**

#### Request

The **logout** transaction requires the user to be logged in, so its session token must be provided in the corresponding header of the `Empty` request.

#### Response
- If, and only if, the logout completed successfully, is sent an Empty response with no errors.
- Otherwise, is provided one of the errors down below.

#### Error codes
| **Code** | Name | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
**E001**|ERR_UNKNOWN| Unprevisible errors
**E002**|ERR_NOT_FOUND| Token header not found
**E005**|ERR_INVALID_TOKEN| Token is invalid because of any of the following reasons: bad format, `exp` time exceeded, bad signature, `nbf` not satisfied, wrong `knd` or not catched.
**E007**|ERR_INVALID_HEADER| Token header must be encoded in base64

## Setup environment

To get the environment ready for the application to run, several steps have to be completed. Luckily all commands are in the [Makefile](./Makefile) of this project, so don't panic ;)

Running the following command in your terminal will create an sql setup script at `migrations/.postgres` as well as a `.ssh` directory where to find the JWT keypair required by the server:
``` bash
$ make setup
```
> This command requires python3 and openssl to be installed

Since is expected to deploy the application using [podman](https://podman.io/), build the rauth image:
``` bash
$ make build
```

Last but not least, the service will expect a directory (`templates` by default) with the following email templates:

| Filename | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
`verification_email.html`| The html template to render and send when an email has to be verified.
`reset_email.html` | The html template to render and send when a user requests for resetting its password.

> Both templates may consume the same variables: `name` and `token`, provided by the server while rendering. 

## Server configuration

The server expects a set of environment variables to work properly. Although some of them has a default value, it is recommended to set all of them to have absolute awareness about how the service will behave.

| Environment variable | Default value | Description |
|:---------------------|:-------------:|:------------|
SERVICE_PORT | 8000 | Port where to expose the gRPC service
SERVICE_NETW | 127.0.0.1 | Network where to expose the gRPC service
POSTGRES_DB |  | `Postgres` database name
POSTGRES_USER |  | `Postgres` username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD |  | `Postgres` user password
POSTGRES_POOL | 10 | `Postgres` connection pool size 
DATABASE_URL | | `Postgres` DSN
REDIS_HOSTNAME | | `Redis` container name
REDIS_DSN | | `Redis` DSN
REDIS_POOL | 10 | `Redis` connection pool size 
TOKEN_TIMEOUT | 7200 | The timeout any token should have
JWT_SECRET | | The JWT secret to sign with all generated tokens (tip: it could be the content of the .ssh/pkcs8_key.base64 file generated on the setup step)
JWT_PUBLIC | | The JWT public key to verify with all comming tokens (tip: it could be the content of the .ssh/pkcs8_pubkey.base64 file generated on the setup step)
JWT_HEADER | authorization | Header where to find/store all JWT
TOTP_HEADER | x-totp-secret | Header where to set the TOTP secret
SMTP_ISSUER | rauth | Name to identify where the emails are sent from
SMTP_ORIGIN | | Email to set as the `from` for all sent emails 
SMTP_TRANSPORT | | Smtp transporter URL (ex.: smtp.gmail.com)
SMTP_TEMPLATES | /etc/rauth/smtp/templates/*.html | Path where to find all email's templates
SMTP_USERNAME | | If required, a username to enable the application to send emails
SMTP_PASSWORD | | If required, an application password to enable the application to send emails
PWD_SUFIX | ::PWD::RAUTH | A suffix to append to all passwords before hashing and storing them

> All these environment variables can be set in a .env file, since Rauth uses dotenv to set up the environment

## Deployment

Since the application needs some external services to be launched, the easiest way to deploy them all is by using [podman-compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose) as following:
```bash
$ make deploy
```

This command will deploy a pod with all those services described in the [compose file](./compose.yaml) of this project. Once completed, the application endpoints will be reachable in two different ways:
- via `grpc` messaging on port `8000`
- via `grpc-web` requests on port `8080`

## Debugging

By default, the deployment command has the `-d` flag enabled, so no logs are displayed. If you really want to see them, you have two options: removing the `-d` flag from the `deploy` command of the [Makefile](./Makefile), which will display all logs of all services, or running the following command to display only those coming from the `rauth-server`:
```bash
$ make follow
```
